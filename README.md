## What it does
  Hopefully it turns your .lss files from LiveSplit into CSV files.
  
## How to use
  Download the code (make sure you have a jdk intalled) and run the App.java in the /scr folder.
  It will ask you for the file path of your .lss (this is relative to the project folder, not the App.java file.)
  It will then ask for the name you want to call your csv, type anything.
  Then it will copy your data and save it to a csv file in the project folder.

## Problems
  This might not work depending on how you have your splits setup,
    For example:
      I have not tested it with gametime timers
